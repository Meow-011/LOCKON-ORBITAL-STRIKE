## 🚀 Key Features

### 🔱 GOD MODE (Active Exploitation)
- **42+ RCE Arsenal**: Fully automated Remote Code Execution for major CVEs (Metabase, PaperCut, Solr, WebLogic, Struts, Log4Shell, etc.).
- **Infrastructure Killers**: Takeover Big Data systems (Hadoop YARN, RocketMQ, HugeGraph) and Monitor tools (Cacti, Zabbix).
- **Auto-Shell**: Automatically uploads Web Shells and establishes Reverse Shells (C2) upon successful exploit.

### 🕸️ Advanced Scanning
- **Deep Recon**: Subdomain enumeration (Subfinder), Tech Detection (Wappalyzer), and WAF Detection.
- **Injection Engine**: SQLi, XSS (DOM/Reflected), NoSQL, LDAP, SSTI, and Command Injection.
- **API Warfare**: GraphQL Introspection, JWT Attack, and Mass Assignment scanning.

### 🛡️ Active Stealth
- **WAF Evasion**: Jitter/Delay randomization and Header rotation.
- **Cortex AI**: Adaptive scanning patterns to avoid detection.

### 🔮 Visual Command Center
- **Orbital Attack Graph**: Visualize the Kill Chain from Recon to Action.
- **Loot Gallery**: Browse captured screenshots, secrets, and files directly in the UI.
